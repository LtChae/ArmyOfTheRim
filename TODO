Make it feel like a military:
  Automatic Resupply:
    ☐ Triggers per quadrum @c# @high
    ☐ Sends a quadrum's worth of food per soldier @c# @high
    | bonus, make sure this is only for soldiers
    | no supply for civilians
    ☐ Optionally send ammo if CE enabled @cross-mod
    ✔ Quartermaster caravan at the same time? @c# @done(24-03-09 10:51)
    ☐ Requisition chits @xml
    | Worth little to other factions, worth full price to military
  Regular Reinforcements:
    ☐ Triggers per year @c# @high
    ☐ Sends enough soldiers for the officers you have @c# @high
    ☐ Requires a command structure @xml
    | (a captain can support x LTs, who can support x SGTs, who can support x CPLs who can support x rankers)
    ☐ Dock performance if casualties were too high? @c#
    | Or cap reinforcements (maybe do this anyway)
  Officers:
    ☐ Promoted via renamed honor @xml @high
    | performance? results?
    ☐ At captain, gain cooldown ability that grants performance to lower officers @xml @probably
    | call it "commendation"
    | conditional on completing missions
    | can be applied to rankers too since they're technically "officers"
    ☐ At lieutenant, gain per quadrum ability to recruit rankers from faction members
    | they must be capable of violence
    ☐ Why are moodlets for officers duplicated?
  Impactful Permits:
    These will be pretty similar to the existing imperial permits
    ☐ Artillery strike
    ☐ Temporary reinforcements
    ☐ Emergency food
    ☐ Emergency medicine
    ☐ Medivac
  Missions and Ops:
    Special tasks, always violent, always awards performance
    ☐ Rescue an Officer
    ☐ Hold POWs
    ☐ Patrols
    | go to nearby place, chance for combat
    | bonus - multiple places in one mission
    ☐ Raids
